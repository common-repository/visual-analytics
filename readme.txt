== Description ==

Allows a site's administrator to connect a Google Analytics account and analyse how WordPress events (posts created or modified, etc.) affect site traffic.

An API code is needed <a href="https://developers.google.com/">from Google</a> before you'll be able to access the analytics platform. 

After connecting with your Analytics account, you'll be able to see a breakdown of traffic by a number of metrics including:

* Day of the week
* Post created or modified, and +1 day from those events
* Author post days
* Category post days
* Unlimited custom time-frames
* Analyze both visitors or pageviews, view by country,
